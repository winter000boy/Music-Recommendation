# üéµ Lyrics-Based Music Recommendation System

A machine learning-based song recommendation system that suggests similar songs based on lyrical content analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

## üéØ Overview

This project implements a content-based recommendation system that analyzes song lyrics to find similar songs. It uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to measure the semantic similarity between songs.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Implementation

- **Data Processing**: 
  - Cleaned and preprocessed lyrics data
  - Implemented text tokenization
  - Applied Porter Stemming for root word extraction
  - Removed stopwords and special characters

- **Feature Engineering**:
  - TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) Vectorization
  - Cosine Similarity Matrix computation
  - Dimensionality: 10,000 songs √ó 26,031 features

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Languages**:
  - Python 3.x

- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: Data manipulation
  - `numpy`: Numerical operations
  - `nltk`: Natural Language Processing
  - `scikit-learn`: ML algorithms (TfidfVectorizer, cosine_similarity)
  - `pickle`: Model serialization

## üìä Dataset

- **Original dataset size**: 57,650 songs
- **Balanced dataset**: 10,000 songs
- **Features**:
  - Artist name
  - Song title
  - Lyrics text

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can check your Python version using:
```bash
python --version
```

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/winter000boy/Music-Recommendation.git
   cd Music-Recommendation
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. **Prepare the dataset**:
   Place your dataset in the `data/` directory. Ensure it is formatted as expected (CSV with columns for artist name, song title, and lyrics).

2. **Run the preprocessing script**:
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```

3. **Train the model**:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

4. **Generate recommendations**:
   ```bash
   python recommend.py "Your song lyrics here"
   ```

### Example

To get recommendations for a song, run:
```bash
python recommend.py "Imagine there's no heaven..."
```
